# Robust Generalized Linear Models

For the MSc Econometrics & Management Science, specializing in Business Analytics & Quantitative Marketing [BAQM], at the Erasmus School of Economics [ESE] in Rotterdam, I have written a short research project for the course "Multivariate Statistics" concerning the effects of outliers or contamination of error terms by heavy-tailed distributions on the variability of parameter estimates. In particular, I have performed a simulation study, in which I applied several robust generalized linear models (Mallows-type M-estimator and MM-estimator) and a benchmark OLS-regression. Should outliers and contamination have significant effects on the variances of the estimates, then the values of often used test statistics such as tâˆ’ and Wald-statistics, the corresponding significance levels of the estimates, and ultimate conclusions drawn based on these outcomes can change drastically. Hence, circumventing such problems is of interest, since it is crucial for actors such as policymakers, organizations and scientists to minimize the probability of drawing incorrect conclusions and/or making undesirable policy decisions.
